    <h3>Cities I've Lived In</h3>
    <div>
      <p>
        I was born and raised in Sacramento, CA for 14 years. 
        We moved to Chattanooga, TN starting my second year of high school. 
        I went to college in Dayton Beach, Fl. 
        After graduating, I started military service, 
        which brought me to all of my other remaining locations.

    <h3>Top 3 Cities to Visit</h3>
    <div>
      <p>
        New York is the first city I need to visit. 
        I've never been and it's relatively close and affordable to travel to.
        I have a fascination for Chinese and Japanese culture growing up doing martial arts. 
        I traveled to China when I was younger, 
        but I would really enjoy visiting Japan, experience its culture, and its food.
        Lastly, Maui. I've had family grow up, live there, and absolutely love Hawaii in general. 
        Maui would be an incredible vacation of relaxation and recreation.
